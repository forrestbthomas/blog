		<p>I mentioned in my first post some snarky comment about reversing a Linked List and its correlation to productive software engineering (apologies for the snark, I should probably work on that) and it made me wonder if I could manage to write the necessary algorithm in an immutable way. I've been learning Clojure for about 6 months now and I feel like I'm getting the hang of it. I'm not a pro by any means, but the basic concepts of immutability, parallelism and a "functional" style of programming seem to have coalesced to a greater or lesser extent. So, I figured, why not try to implement something that I felt confident enough about to be snarky?</p>
		<p>As it would so turn out, the problem was a little more difficult than I anticipated. I can't tell if that implies I have a long way to go in learning Clojure or if that means I don't have as solid of an understanding of the underlying data structure and algorithm as I thought I did, or some combination of both. Regardless, it was a fun little exercise and I figured I'd share what I learned. I guess it makes sense just to walk through the various code blocks needed for the problem.</p>
		<p>As you might imagine, when implementing a Linked List and reversing it, I need the standard <code>Node</code> and <code>List</code> data structures:
		<pre>
<code class="clojure">
;; Node Data Structure
(defn new-node
  [v]
  (assoc {} :val v :next nil))

;; List Data Structure
(defn new-list
  [node]
  (assoc {} :head node))

</code>
		</pre>
		</p>
		<p>
		Unlike in a language like Java, where I would be creating a Node class and List class, here I'm creating functions that return the data structure that I want. Realistically, I don't need to create these functions, as they are simply creating maps with specified values, but I like the abstraction. Like any good Linked List, I also need to be able to add Nodes to the List. In my head, I think of adding a Node in two ways: at the beginning and at the end (I guess I also think about inserting a Node in the middle, but I didn't do that here). With that in mind I created the following functions:
		<pre>
<code class="clojure">
;; Prepends a Node to the passed in List
(defn prepend
  [list node]
  (->> list
       :head
       (assoc node :next)
       (assoc list :head)))


</code>
		</pre>
		<sub>Sidenote: My first intuition is to defend my code because I assume it isn't "idiomatic" (which is typically an underhanded way of someone saying that your code isn't written in the way the other person likes), but I'm gonna leave it here just the way it is cuz I like the look of it.</sub>
		<p> <code>Prepend</code> is pretty straightforward. It:</p>
		<p>- accepts a List and a Node to prepend</p>
		<p>- gets the <code>head</code> of the passed in List</p>
		<p>- associates that value as the <code>next</code> value of the passed in Node and returns the new Node</p>
		<p>- finally, associates that new Node as the new <code>head</code> property of the List and returns the new List.</p>
		<p><code>Prepend</code> is that simple because at the end of the day I just need to change a couple of values and those values are accessible without any looping or recursion. That's important because the next function, <code>append</code> requires some looping in order to append a Node to the end of the List and due to Clojure's immutable data structures that ended up being trickier than I thought.</p>
		</p>
		<pre>
<code class="clojure">
;; Appends a Node to the passed in List
(defn append
  [list node]
  (loop [n (:head list)
	 path [:head]]
	(if (:next n)
	  (recur (:next n) (conj path :next))
	  (assoc-in list (conj path :next) node))))

</code>
		</pre>
		<p>
		In mutation-land, appending a Node to the end of a List is trivial - loop until the end of the List, append. This only works, however, because I have the ability to <i>mutate</i> the List such that the tail Node's <code>next</code> property is updated to be the inserted Node. In the world of Clojure's immutable data structures though, I have to make sure that I am returning the updated List and not rely on side-effects to change the original. After thinking about it a bit, the solution I came up with involves looping over the List while keeping track of the "path" of where I am in the list (<code>assoc-in</code> is very useful here since it takes a vector of keys - not sure how I would do this otherwise). Once I find that I am at the end of the list, I use <code>assoc-in</code> to update the List at that path by appending the passed in Node as the <code>next</code> property of the current tail Node and then returning the updated List.
		</p>
		<p>
		Now that I finished giving myself some basic functions to create Nodes and Lists, prepend and append, I had to figure out how to reverse one. The pattern I used for this, as you'll see, is similar to the pattern for appending, since I want to perform a similar looping action.
		<pre>
<code class="clojure">
;; Reverse a given list
(defn ll-reverse
  [list]
  (loop [current (:head list)
	 prev nil
	 next nil
	 l list
	 path [:head]]
	(if current
	  (let [path (conj path :next)
		next (:next current)
		new-current (assoc current :next prev)
		l (assoc-in l path prev)
		prev new-current
		current next]
	    (recur current prev next l path))
	    (assoc l :head prev))))

</code>
		</pre>
		</p>
		<p>
		The general algorithm for reversing remains the same, but gets updated slightly to deal with immutability. I loop over the List in the same way as I did with <code>append</code>, keeping track of the "path" into the List. I use 3 variables to keep track of the previous, current and next Nodes, as well as the list itself. That part is a bit different than the norm because I need to update the list, return it, and pass it to the next <code>recur</code> block in order to effectively alter each Node's <code>next</code> property to switch to the "previous" Node. Each recur block walks through the process of changing the assignment of the <code>path</code>, <code>next</code>, <code>prev</code> and <code>current</code> variables in order for the Node's in the List to point to their new <code>next</code>'s. Also, instead of simply "switching" the <code>next</code> pointer of each Node as a side-effect, I need to update the property of the Node and return the updated Node as the new <code>current</code> Node. That part is also a little different because I can't rely on side-effects and mutation to update each Node.
		</p>
		<p>
		After all of that, what I end up with is a set of code that allows me to create Nodes and Lists, prepend, append and reverse Lists.
		<pre>
<code class="clojure-repl">
;; Create Nodes - same repeated for n2 and n3
user=> (def n1 (new-node 1))
#'user/n1
user=> n1
{:val 1, :next nil}

;; Create list
user=> (def l1 (new-list n1))
#'user/l1
user=> l1
{:head {:val 1, :next nil}}

;; Prepend
user=> (def l2 (prepend l1 n2))
#'user/l2
user=> l2
{:head {:val 2, :next {:val 1, :next nil}}}

;; Append
user=> (def l3 (append l2 n3))
#'user/l3
user=> l3
{:head {:val 2, :next {:val 1, :next {:val 3, :next nil}}}}

;; Reverse
user=> (def reversed (ll-reverse l3))
#'user/reversed
user=> reversed
{:head {:val 3, :next {:val 1, :next {:val 2, :next nil}}}}

;; The reverse of the reversed List is equal to the original
user=> (= l3 (ll-reverse reversed))
true

</code>

		<p>Well, there you have it - reversing a Linked List in Clojure. It was a fun exercise and I'm glad I did it. Moral of the story - immutability still breaks my brain sometimes.
