		<p>Ok, not really. Here I am, at it again. My third attempt at a blog. Why do I put myself through this? Usually what happens is that I start a blog, write a couple of posts about things that I'm learning and then I lose interest and move on to other things. What makes this time different? Probably nothing, but I know that its important to write about what I'm learning, at the very least because blogs are the primary way new companies evaluate candidates (that and their GitHub repos). Yeah, there are the actual coding interviews, but I'm not gonna get too bent out of shape about companies that care <i>A LOT</i> about how you code in a coding interview. I'll just continue doing what everyone else does: read and memorize Cracking The Coding Interview, do a million problems on LeetCode and I'll be fine. Apparently that's the best measure we can come up with to determine the relative potential success of candidates. To be fair, it does seem like a hard problem to solve, but then again it also seems like we have enough data by this time to realize that memorizing how to reverse a Linked List doesn't correlate <i>at all</i> with how successful someone will be as an engineer. But I digress...</p>
		<p>Or do I? I guess maybe that's as good of a place as any to start my new blog, and might also lend itself towards an explanation of why I am writing this blog by hand in HTML and just saving it to GitHub rather than using WebAssembly-Native-React-Flux-Webpack-Treeshaking-SinglePageApplication-CLI-Component-SASS-Precompiled-CircleCI-CI/CD-Awesomesauce. See, like you, I care about what I care about. I find interesting, what I find interesting. I optimize for what I optimize. And, at this particular place in my life, I don't care a whole lot about front-end buzzwords because I don't find the technology that interesting (nor do I think it will even exist in about 5-10 years) and so I am no longer optimizing for it. I get that, for <b>A LOT</b> of people, front-end technology is infinitely interesting and they care deeply about it. That's awesome. Anytime someone is really, truly passionate about a certain technology and they have the opportunity to put it to good use on the regular, I am really happy for them. It's just not for me. Maybe that means I'm missing out, but I'm OK with that. Just like I'm OK with missing out on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balut_(food)">Balut</a>. There are people who are nuts about that stuff. It would take a lot of dollar bills to make me eat that. Again, I digress...</p>
		<p>So, what <i>do</i> I care about right now then? The key to that question is "right now" because my interests change all the time. It seems like I am into novelty more than anything else. So, once I learn something to a certain extent I just kinda lose interest unless the topic at hand is by its nature an evolving topic. At the moment, I'm really interested in stream processing. The idea of getting loads and loads of data constantly and building a system that is performant enough to handle the load, resilient enough to deal with errors, and interesting enough to do something meaningful with the data its getting is really, really interesting to me. For example, I am working on a personal project right now that consumes the Twitter streaming API in order to filter the tweets based on keywords, analyze the sentiment of the tweets and overlay that sentiment on a map to show the relative locations of sentiment. I'm using Clojure, Kafka and Onyx for the stream processing and I'll probably use raw D3 and HTML5/CSS3 for the display (once I get that far). It's been a lot of fun so far and I really look forward to having a POC to put up on GitHub and show off.</p>
		<p>I guess that's all I really wanted to say at the moment. Other than that, thanks for reading (mom) and hopefully I won't just give up on this blog like I have all my others. Laterz.</p>
